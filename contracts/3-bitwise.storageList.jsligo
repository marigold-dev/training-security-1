#import "3-bitwise.jsligo" "Contract"

// When this file was created, the smart contract was defined with an entrypoint using `@entry` that was not within a namespace. As such, the examples below are written with that assumption in mind.
// IMPORTANT: We suggest always explicitly typing your storage values:

const storage: Contract.storage = 2n;
